# Florida Drupal Camp 2022 - Advanced Themeing Training

This repository was developed along with an [accompanying presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1z8lvO04ibtbEuAA5CsBecdMWI6UBA4QQFReRYArkNL4/edit?usp=sharing).

Git tags are used heavily to provide easy jump-in/rollback points for individuals to follow along

The training was developed with the following stack in mind:

- VS Code [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- DDEV [install](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

If you'd prefer to not install these programs on your machine, you can utilize gitpod.io to mimic the environment from a cloud-hosted machine. It's a remarkably similar experience. You'll need a free, public github.com account for this. [Launch this repo in gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#DDEV_REPO=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fandy-blum%2Ffl-demo,DDEV_ARTIFACTS=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fandy-blum%2Ffl-demo/https://github.com/drud/ddev-gitpod-launcher/)

Other configurations are certainly possible, but this is the one I'll be leading with.
